# Identify and Remove Suspicious Browser Extensions

##  Objective

The goal of this task is to learn how to identify, review, and safely remove potentially harmful browser extensions in order to improve browser security and performance.


##  Tools Used

- **Browser:** Google Chrome
- **Extension Manager:** `chrome://extensions/`


##  Steps Followed

1. Opened the browser's **extension/add-ons manager** using `chrome://extensions/`.
2. Reviewed **all installed extensions** to assess trust, usage, and purpose.
3. Examined **permissions** for each extension using the ‚ÄúDetails‚Äù section.
4. Cross-checked **user reviews, ratings**, and **publisher credibility** online.
5. Flagged **unused or suspicious** extensions based on permission scope and unknown sources.
6. Removed selected extensions and **restarted the browser**.
7. Researched how **malicious extensions** can harm user security and privacy.
8. Documented every step clearly along with findings, screenshots, and reflections.


##  Extensions Removed
